# Tic-Tac-Toe-game-using-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript

This code creates a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game board is made up of a 3x3 grid, created using CSS grid. Each cell in the grid is represented by a <div> element with the class cell. The X's and O's are added to the cells when the player clicks on them, using JavaScript.

The game logic is implemented using a function called checkForWinner(), which checks for winning combinations of X's or O's on the board. If a winning combination is found, the game is reset and a message is displayed indicating which player has won. If there is no winner after a move, the game switches to the other player's turn.

A reset button is included at the bottom of the page to allow players to start a new game. The resetGame() function clears the board and resets the game to the starting state.

Overall, this code creates a simple and functional Tic Tac Toe game that can be played in a web browser.
